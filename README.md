# d

`d` is a command line tool to quickly retrieve the definitions of a word or
term. 

This is mostly an experiment for me to play with Elixir processes. Does it work?
Yes. Does it crash if it can't find the word? Yup. Do I care? Nope.

## Installation

Current installation is very basic. Once you've cloned the repository–and we're
assuming you have Elixir installed–run the following command:

```
mix escript.build
```

This will create the `d` executable which you can then copy/move to whatever
directory you want.

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

LOL! Seriously? Don't you have something better to do?
